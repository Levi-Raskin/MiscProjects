This classic statistics problem comes from the Monty Hall game show (if that's the name-- I was born after 2000). The problem is set up as such:

Say you have three doors to pick from, one of which contains a car and the other two a goat. You keep whatever is behind the door. Personally, a goat is probably a better prize seeing that I live in a city and goats don't require insurance. But, suppose you wanted the car. You pick a door and then the host reveals what is behind one of the doors you did not pick and gives you an opportunity to swap your choice. Do you do so?

This is a problem about information in statistics and that's part of what makes it unintuitive-- the host adds infomration to the system. If Monty revealed the door with a car, you would obviously pick that door. It wouldn't be very dramatic. Likewise, he cannot reveal what is behind your door because then, if its a goat, you would swap 100% of the time and if its a car, you wouldn't swap. Again, not very dramatic. 

Because of this, Monty effectively *filters* the set for you. An easier way to think about it (and code that I'm working on writing here and there-- monty hall with n doors, m choices, and o correct doors) is if there were 100 doors and monty reveals 98 incorrect doors. Do you stick with the 1:100 chance you originally had? Probably not.

However, as nice as this is, this can be very unintuitive and, despite explanation to the B215 students, some did not believe us. Thus, I went out and wrote this simulation code to simualte the Monty Hall experiment and thus, derive the proportion of cars you earn by swapping vs not swapping.
